# README

To ensure this chat demo runs properly you should need these dependencies with the following versions:

Ruby version: 3.1.1p18
Rails version: 6.1.5
SQLite3 version: 3.38.2
Redis version 6.2.6 which should be running on localhost with port 6379

Since this app is only a demo i used the .env file to store google credentials rather than encrypted credentials which would usually be the choice.
